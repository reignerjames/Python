This repository is a copy of Reigner Casangcapan's Python work. 

1. Interactive Data Processing Application is a very basic app for a library system. v2 does not change the code whatsoever - only edits the comments.
2. Program to draw a visualization of a given data set. Translating the file and combining the original 3 files together had broken the code somewhere unfortunately. It was given 100% marks on my assignement.
